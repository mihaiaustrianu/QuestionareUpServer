Powered by Node.js and Express, the project provides robust and efficient handling of data. Leveraging MongoDB as the database, it ensures scalability and flexibility in data storage and retrieval. 

MongoDB, a NoSQL database, enables the storage of structured and unstructured data, accommodating the dynamic nature of the application's content. Utilizing Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, facilitates interaction with the database, ensuring data consistency and integrity.

The backend architecture follows best practices, including modularization and middleware implementation for enhanced maintainability and extensibility. Authentication and authorization mechanisms are integrated using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure access to resources.

With MongoDB as the backend database, coupled with Node.js and Express, this project offers a scalable, performant, and reliable foundation for the questionare application.
